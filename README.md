I am in progress to create an authorization webpage to test my ReactJS knowledge.

My plan is to develop a landing page where the user can enter details such as username, email, and password. User with valid input can pass through the registration process, whereas users with invalid inputs will see an appropriate error text to lead them to the right path.
